## What is This?
My Monte Carlo Simulations are a surface-level foray into how random sampling can be used to model:
- Stochastic Methods
- American/European Option pricings
- General Geometry/Mathematical Problems

## Why Make it?
This is a personal exercise towards understanding how computers can be used to power processes that are simply too imprecise
or multi-faceted for math modeling. I started this project as a senior in highschool, and am primarily using this as a learning
exercise

## The Math and Theory Behind it
As this python repo continues to grow, the math and financial theory behind it are primarily directed towards being able to
entirely model and understand the Black-Scholes model, in addition to my formal education. Taking apart pieces of the model,
such as brownian motion and derivations of it using It√¥ Calculus, in a divide-and-conquer way allows me to supplement the
theoretical with real outputs.
