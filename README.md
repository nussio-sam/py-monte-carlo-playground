# py-monte-carlo-playground

## What is This?
Having skimmed through Glasserman's bible of quant, I find myself in the wonderful position to outweigh my own capabilities
This contains, and will contain, a clear analysis of the way I learn both Monte-Carlo and its backbone in measure theory throughout time
I'm a math major after all, this is where I live.

### The Future of This:
- Add comparative calculations between pure black-scholes closed-form
- Add comparative calculations between geometric and arithmetic Asian
- Standard comparisons to trees in American
- Finalize all greeks for each option
- Add futures?
## Why Make it?
This is a personal exercise towards understanding how I can use programming for either scientific or industry usage to evaluate hugely
complex systems, and learn why elegant and discrete solutions to such problems are so important in the world. 
The motto of this is:
** Take Nothing for Granted **

## The Math and Theory Behind it
As this python repo continues to grow, the math and financial theory behind it are primarily directed towards being able to
entirely model and understand the Black-Scholes model, in addition to my formal education. Taking apart pieces of the model,
such as brownian motion and derivations of it using It√¥ Calculus, in a divide-and-conquer way allows me to supplement the
theoretical with real outputs.
